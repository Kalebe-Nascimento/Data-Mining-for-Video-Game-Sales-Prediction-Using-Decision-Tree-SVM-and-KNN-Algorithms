# Data-Mining-for-Video-Game-Sales-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-SVM-and-KNN-Algorithms
This project focuses on predicting video game genres based on a comprehensive dataset of video game sales. We employ three machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
